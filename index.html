            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>We combine trajectory prediction and motion planning to autonomously fly a DJI Tello drone through a rolled hula-hoop.
                    By using a motion capture room, we are able to exactly localize the hoop, infer its velocity, and predict its trajectory.
                    The drone's position is determined and a goal point is converted to the drone's frame of reference.
                </p>
                <p>Our initial plan was to fly the drone through a thrown hoop, however,
                    the slow speed of the drone (1 m/s) made it impossible for the drone to reach the hoop before it hit the ground.
                    We expect that a faster drone would be able to fly through a hoop mid-air.
                </p>

                <p>This system is applicable in any tracking feature, such as in sports games, where cameras must follow players and the ball, and determine the best pose to capture the game.
                    It could also be useful for emergency dynamic obstacle avoidance, where there are sudden obstacles that are in the way, and the drone must figure out the best way to avoid it by inferring its path.
                    In our problem, we aim to go to the point, but the underlying tracking is similar.</p>
                <p>To encourage future development, we release our code at <a href="https://github.com/festusev/HulaHoopDrone">https://github.com/festusev/HulaHoopDrone</a>.</p>

                    <p>We had three main objectives/design criteria:</p>

                        <li>Drone to pass through hoop accurately and reliably; the drone should ideally pass through the middle of the hoop.</li>
                        <li>Drone to efficiently pass through hoop. Drone should be able to pass through the hoop when feasible, and not always take the safest trajectory </li>
                        <li>Ensure adaptability based on hoop throws. Able to adapt to different hoop trajectories, in terms of speed and apex height. </li>

                    <p>We made several design decisions that were critical for successfully flying through the hoop:</p>

                            <h3>Reflectors Configuration</h3>
                            <p>Motion Capture relies on infrared (IR) reflectors which are attached to an object to track it.
                                We attached four reflectors symmetrically to the hoop, and designated the mean position as the position of the hoop's center.
                                Determining a marker configuration for the drone was more tricky because we had to maintain the weight distribution, or the drone would be unstable while flying.
                                It was also important to have an asymmetric configuration for the Vicon tracking system to be able to identify the orientation of the drone.
                                If the reflectors are in a symmetric configuration, there may be two or even four possible orientations of the drone.</p>

                            <h3>Trajectory Prediction</h3>
                            <p>To predict the trajectory of the hoop, we kept a buffer of its previous positions.
                                Assuming that the errors in the position estimate were Gaussian and that the trajectory was best fit by a parabola, we used least squares to estimate the hoop's initial position, velocity, and acceleration.
                                Using these parameters, we predicted the hoop's positions for the next five seconds.
                                We experimented with different strategies for clipping the position buffer, where there is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, as well as a danger of using points that are from when the hoop was at rest.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Feasible Point Selection</h3>
                            <p>We experimented with several methods for determining the goal point that the drone would fly through.
                            To compensate for the slow speed of the drone, we used the point the hoop would be at in three seconds.
                            This gave the highest success rate because the drone had time to accelerate and reach the position simultaneously with the hoop.</p>

                <h3>Hardware Setup and Localization</h3>
                <p>We used the following hardware: </p>
                <ul class="formatted-list">
                    <li>69 cm diameter hoop for the drone to fly through</li>
                    <li>Drone: DJI Tello – controlled using Tello SDK, in order to fly autonomously through a predicted location of the hoop in the future</li>
                    <li>MoCap Room: To get exact coordinates of drone and hoop</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On VICON Tracker App, we could create objects for the hoop and drone based on the markers and create the body coordinate frame as well.</p>
        
                <p>Localizing the Hoop:</p>
                <ul class="formatted-list">
                    <li>We attached 4 IR-reflecting markers to the hoop</li>
                    <li>Define the center of mass to be the average of these 4 points, which will be the midpoint of the hoop</li>
                    <li>Configure Vicon to publish this position to a rostopic. Vicon publishes points at ~125 Hz.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>Localizing the Drone:</p>
                <ul class="formatted-list">
                    <li>We attached 5 IR-reflecting markers to the drone in an asymmetrical manner</li>
                    <li>Asymmetrical configuration reduces ambiguity in marker identification of body</li>
                    <li>Define the origin to be the top marker on the marker configuration. Configure Vicon to publish this position to a rostopic.</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>As mentioned, we could only get the hoop to fly through a rolling hoop. There are certain constraints still, such as the speed of the hoop, and the distance between the hoop and the drone. This is solely due to the hardware constraints of the drone. Due to this issue, we were not able to meet the design criteria of getting the drone to fly through a hoop in the air.</p>

                <p>We were still able to predict the hoop trajectory well, and get the drone to fly in the right direction of the "feasible" point. However, due to the latency and its inability to fly quickly, the drone would always be too late.</p>

                <p class="highlight">
                    We encountered difficulties with the drone control, since it is very limited in control (can only control velocity of drone, no pitch/roll control), and it has some variable time latency. It was difficult handling the noise in the control commands, plus the delay for the drone to follow the command.
                </p>

                <p>One hack/flaw we used was to simply pick the first feasible point that is within the required velocity limit, which may not lead to the most smooth hoop passing trajectory of the drone. However, it should still work reliably, since we throw the hoop in front of the drone, so the plane of the hoop where the drone can pass will likely always provide an angle for the drone to pass through it.</p>
