        <h2>Design Criteria</h2>
        <p>
            Outline the specific functional requirements and constraints 
            that your robotics project needed to meet. What were the key 
            performance metrics and design goals?
        </p>

        <h2>Design Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the design solution you developed. What approach did you choose, 
            and why was it the most suitable for meeting your project's objectives?
        </p>

        <h2>Design Trade-offs</h2>
        <p>
            Discuss the key design decisions and compromises you made during development.
